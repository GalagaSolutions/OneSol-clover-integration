# Clover-GoHighLevel Integration Setup Guide (V2 API)

## üìã Overview

This integration connects Clover payment processing with GoHighLevel CRM using the **V2 Custom Provider API**, allowing:
- ‚úÖ Online payments via GHL invoices, order forms, and payment links
- ‚úÖ Physical Clover device payments updating GHL invoices (via webhooks)
- ‚úÖ Automatic invoice status updates
- ‚úÖ Transaction tracking and verification

---

## üéØ Current Status

### Working ‚úÖ
- OAuth flow and token management
- Clover payment processing (sandbox tested $10)
- Payment form UI with Clover tokenization
- Transaction ID generation

### In Progress üîÑ
- **GHL Invoice Updates**: Payments process but invoices don't update automatically
- **Integration Registration**: Need to properly register with GHL V2 API
- **Query URL Implementation**: Backend handlers for GHL payment requests

### Issue üîç
The payment is successful in Clover but the GHL invoice doesn't update because:
1. Missing proper integration registration with GHL
2. Query URL not configured in app settings
3. GHL not calling our verification endpoint

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: OAuth and Setup ‚úÖ

**Check OAuth Flow:**
```bash
# Check if tokens stored
curl https://api.onesolutionapp.com/api/test/diagnostics?locationId=YOUR_LOCATION_ID
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "locationId": "cv3mmKLIVdqbZSVeksCW",
  "hasAccessToken": true,
  "hasRefreshToken": true,
  "tokenExpires": "2025-10-15T...",
  "isExpired": false,
  "scopeCount": 12
}
```

### Test 2: Integration Registration üîÑ

**Check if integration created:**
- Go to GHL: **Settings ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Integrations**
- Look for "Clover by PNC"

**If not showing:**
```bash
# Check Vercel logs during OAuth flow
# Look for "Creating payment integration..." message
# Check for API errors
```

**Manual Registration Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.onesolutionapp.com/api/config/save-clover-config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": "YOUR_LOCATION_ID",
    "merchantId": "RCTSTAVI0010002",
    "apiToken": "your_api_token",
    "publicKey": "your_pakms_key",
    "liveMode": false
  }'
```

### Test 3: Standalone Payment Form ‚úÖ WORKING

**Create Test Invoice in GHL:**
1. Go to **Payments ‚Üí Invoices**
2. Create new invoice for $10.00
3. Copy invoice ID

**Access Payment Form:**
```
https://api.onesolutionapp.com/payment-form?amount=10.00&invoiceId=YOUR_INVOICE_ID&locationId=YOUR_LOCATION_ID&customerEmail=test@example.com&customerName=Test%20User
```

**Test Card:**
- **Number:** `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- **Exp:** Any future date (e.g., `12/26`)
- **CVV:** `123`
- **ZIP:** `12345`

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Payment processes in Clover
- ‚úÖ Transaction ID returned
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invoice doesn't update (this is the issue we're fixing)

### Test 4: GHL-Initiated Payment (TO BE TESTED)

**Once integration is properly registered:**

1. **Create Invoice in GHL**
2. **Send to Customer** (or access yourself)
3. **Customer clicks "Pay Now"**
4. **GHL loads your payment iframe** (`paymentsUrl`)
5. **Customer enters card details**
6. **Payment processes**
7. **GHL calls queryUrl to verify**
8. **Invoice updates automatically** ‚úÖ

**To verify GHL is calling your endpoints:**
```bash
# Monitor Vercel logs in real-time
# Look for these log messages:
# "üîî Query URL called from GHL"
# "‚úÖ VERIFY request"
```

### Test 5: Clover Device Payment ‚Üí Invoice Update

**Setup:**
1. Create invoice in GHL ($10.00)
2. Track invoice:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.onesolutionapp.com/api/invoice/track \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": "YOUR_LOCATION_ID",
    "invoiceId": "YOUR_INVOICE_ID",
    "amount": 10
  }'
```

**Process Payment:**
1. Charge $10.00 on Clover test device
2. (Optional) Add invoice ID in payment note

**Verify:**
- Check Vercel logs for:
  - `üîî Webhook received from Clover`
  - `üí≥ Payment event detected!`
  - `üéØ Matched to invoice`
  - `‚úÖ Invoice updated!`
- Check GHL invoice status

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Integration Not Showing in GHL

**Symptoms:**
- OAuth completes successfully
- Setup page loads
- But "Clover by PNC" doesn't appear in Payments ‚Üí Integrations

**Causes:**
1. App category not set to "Third Party Provider"
2. Integration creation API call failed during OAuth
3. Wrong API endpoint or payload format

**Solutions:**

**Check App Category:**
- Go to Marketplace Dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Profile
- Ensure **Category = "Third Party Provider"**
- Save and reinstall app

**Check Integration Creation:**
```bash
# View Vercel logs during OAuth
# Look for:
# "üì§ Creating payment integration..."
# "‚úÖ Payment integration created"

# Or errors like:
# "‚ö†Ô∏è Integration creation failed: ..."
```

**Manual Integration Creation:**
```bash
# Get your access token from diagnostics endpoint
# Then create integration:
curl -X POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/payments/custom-provider/connect \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Clover by PNC",
    "description": "Accept payments via Clover",
    "imageUrl": "https://www.clover.com/assets/images/public-site/press/clover_logo_primary.png",
    "locationId": "YOUR_LOCATION_ID",
    "queryUrl": "https://api.onesolutionapp.com/api/payment/query",
    "paymentsUrl": "https://api.onesolutionapp.com/payment-form"
  }'
```

### Issue 2: Payments Work But Invoice Doesn't Update

**Symptoms:**
- Payment processes successfully in Clover
- Transaction ID returned
- But GHL invoice stays "Unpaid"

**Current Status:** This is the main issue we're fixing

**Causes:**
1. GHL not calling your `queryUrl` for verification
2. Integration not properly registered
3. Query URL not configured in app settings

**Solutions:**

**Verify Query URL Configuration:**
- Marketplace Dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Payment Provider
- Ensure **queryUrl** = `https://api.onesolutionapp.com/api/payment/query`
- Save

**Check if GHL Calls Your Endpoint:**
```bash
# Monitor Vercel logs during payment
# Should see:
# "üîî Query URL called from GHL"
# "‚úÖ VERIFY request"

# If you DON'T see these, GHL isn't calling you
```

**If GHL Isn't Calling:**
1. Integration not properly registered (see Issue 1)
2. Payment not initiated through GHL (use GHL invoice, not standalone form)
3. App not set as default payment provider

**Set as Default:**
- GHL: Settings ‚Üí Payments ‚Üí Integrations
- Find "Clover by PNC"
- Click **"Set as Default"**

### Issue 3: Clover Webhook Not Received

**Symptoms:**
- Device payment processed
- But GHL invoice doesn't update
- No webhook logs in Vercel

**Solutions:**

**Check Webhook Configuration:**
- Clover Dashboard ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Webhooks
- Verify URL: `https://api.onesolutionapp.com/webhooks/clover`
- Verify Status: **Active**
- Verify Events: `PAYMENT_CREATED`, `CREATE`

**Test Webhook Manually:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.onesolutionapp.com/webhooks/clover \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "PAYMENT_CREATED",
    "merchantId": "RCTSTAVI0010002",
    "objectId": "test_payment_id"
  }'

# Check Vercel logs for:
# "üîî Webhook received from Clover"
```

**Check Webhook Logs in Clover:**
- Clover Dashboard ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Webhooks
- Click on your webhook
- View "Recent Deliveries"
- Check for delivery failures

### Issue 4: API Key Verification Failed

**Symptoms:**
- Query URL called but returns 401
- Logs show "‚ùå Missing apiKey" or "‚ùå Invalid apiKey"

**Cause:**
- API key not properly stored during config save
- GHL sending wrong API key

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if API key stored:
# Look in Redis for key pattern: api_key_*

# Regenerate by re-saving config:
curl -X POST https://api.onesolutionapp.com/api/config/save-clover-config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": "YOUR_LOCATION_ID",
    "merchantId": "RCTSTAVI0010002",
    "apiToken": "your_token",
    "liveMode": false
  }'
```

## üìä API Flow Diagrams

### Flow 1: GHL-Initiated Payment (How it SHOULD work)

```
1. Customer receives GHL invoice
   ‚Üì
2. Clicks "Pay Now" in email/SMS
   ‚Üì
3. GHL loads YOUR paymentsUrl in iframe
   (/payment-form)
   ‚Üì
4. Iframe sends "ready" event to GHL
   ‚Üì
5. GHL sends payment data to iframe
   (amount, customer, orderId, etc.)
   ‚Üì
6. Customer enters card details
   Clover tokenizes card
   ‚Üì
7. Iframe sends token to YOUR backend
   (/api/payment/process-iframe)
   ‚Üì
8. YOUR backend processes with Clover
   Returns chargeId
   ‚Üì
9. Iframe sends success event to GHL
   with chargeId
   ‚Üì
10. GHL calls YOUR queryUrl
    type: "verify"
    chargeId: "clv_xxx"
    ‚Üì
11. YOUR queryUrl returns
    { success: true }
    ‚Üì
12. GHL marks invoice as PAID ‚úÖ
```

### Flow 2: Device Payment ‚Üí Invoice Update

```
1. Customer pays on Clover device
   ‚Üì
2. Clover sends webhook to YOUR server
   ‚Üì
3. YOUR webhook handler receives payment
   ‚Üì
4. Match payment to invoice:
   - By amount + timestamp
   - By invoice ID in payment note
   ‚Üì
5. If match found:
   Get GHL access token
   ‚Üì
6. Call GHL API to record payment
   (using payment orders API)
   ‚Üì
7. GHL invoice updated ‚úÖ
```
